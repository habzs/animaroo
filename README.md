# animaroo.

animaroo is a mobile grooming/dog-walking service that concieved with the intent to help improve the lives of both pet and their owners. At animaroo, owners would be able to care for their pet's up keeping without ever having to leave the comfort of their house.

The main focus of this project was to create a fully functioning client-server application using vanilla PHP. animaroo has an intuitive user interface design with the aim of accessibility in mind. A fully fledged database was implemented with the ability to create and manage user profiles (upload photos, quick search, etc), a forum for discussions and a e-commerce product page.
